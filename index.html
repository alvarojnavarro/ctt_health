    <p>Several types of mental illnesses do not have apparent social symptoms. But as invisible as they are, mental health issues will affect one in four people at some point in their life. Virtual reality treats what is real with the unreal, and what you
      can't see with tangible methods.</p>

    <p>The answer lies in VR’s extraordinary ability to create powerful simulations of the scenarios in which psychological difficulties occur. Most powerful changes happen when individuals are presented with the situations that cause them distress and directly
      learn how to think, feel, and behave more constructively.</p>
    </br>
    <h2>From the US army to therapy couch</h2>
    <p>Virtual reality therapy (VRT) was pioneered and originally termed in 1992 supported by funding from U.S. Army Research Laboratory. An early exploration in psychological application began in 1993–1994. The use of VRT has thus become a mainstream psychiatric
      treatment for anxiety disorders and is finding increasing use in the treatment of other cognitive disorders associated with various medical conditions such as autism, PTSD, anxiety and phobias.</p>
    </br>
    <h2>Applications of VR for therapy purposes</h2>
    <p>There are four main methods of virtual reality treatment.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Uninhibiting Patients</b> Virtual reality therapy allows patients to more openly divulge information they would otherwise feel hesitant to deliver in a true setting.</li>
      <li><b>Training Clinicians</b> Virtual reality therapy simulations allow trainee clinicians to practice interviews, assessments and therapy sessions on simulated clientel, in order to perfect their craft prior to working on real patients.
        <li><b>Cognitive behavioral therapy</b> People with cognitive behavioural hindrances struggle to achieve normality in their daily lives. Virtual reality CBT allows them to overcome these disruptions in regular routines via steady behavioural alterations
          within simulations. This allows them to accept, cognitively, that a behavioural action, or lack there of, can be adapted to their behaviour.</li>
        <li><b>Exposure therapy</b> Virtualy reality allows clinicians to gradually desensitize patients to the stimulant that causes an irrational response within their cognitive processes.</li>
    </ul>
    </br>
    <h2>Any situation at the click of a mouse</h2>
    <p>In what follows we will focus on Exposure therapy methods via virtual reality, by showing an example of what a real session would look like.</p>

    <h2>The way forward</h2>

    <p>Although VR could be the way forward for psychological therapy, more empirical research is necessary to establish its applicability. Moreover, a broader spectrum of illnesses need to be addressed via this method in order for it to be widely accepted
      as best practice.</p>

    <p>Nonetheless, virtual reality has proved to be a ground breaking method for mental illness treatment. Suddenly, there’s no need for a therapist to accompany a client on a trip to a crowded shopping centre, or up a tall building. Any situation that
      is more or less impossible to build into a course of therapy can be conjured at the click of a mouse.</p>
